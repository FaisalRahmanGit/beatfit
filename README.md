# BeatFit

BeatFit is a lightweight, static landing page prototype for a fitness-focused music application that intelligently adapts music to workout intensity, intervals, and user mood. The project demonstrates how music, science, and technology can combine to enhance workout performance and motivation.

This repository contains the **frontend-only demo site**, built to showcase the concept, features, and user experience of the BeatFit app.

## Project Overview

Traditional workout playlists are static and often fail to match workout structure. BeatFit addresses this problem by promoting **smart music mixing** that aligns with interval training, recovery periods, endurance sessions, and psychological states such as focus or relaxation.

The landing page communicates this value proposition through a modern, responsive, single-page design optimized for clarity, performance, and visual impact.

## How It Works

* A **single-page layout** introduces BeatFit’s core ideas, features, and benefits
* A **responsive feature slider** (Swiper.js) highlights key functionalities such as:

  * Interval-based music mixing
  * Live music control during workouts
  * Automated DJ-style mixes for endurance training
* An embedded **product explainer video** visually demonstrates the concept
* **FAQ accordion sections** present additional details without cluttering the UI
* Minimal JavaScript enhances interactivity while keeping performance high

The JavaScript logic dynamically adapts the slider layout across screen sizes using breakpoints, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
